# CMSIS DSP for PlatformIO
This repository is a copy based on https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5.
It extracts the DSP source code to be used within PlatformIO.
Add
```
lib_deps =
    https://github.com/nicbres/cmsis-dsp.git#5.8.0
```
to the `platform.ini` file to use the CMSIS DSP library code.
